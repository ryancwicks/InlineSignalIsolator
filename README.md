# Inline Signal Isolator

This project contains the board and code used in the inline signal isolator.

This signal isolator takes an input voltage between 18 and 72VDC, and then isolated an outgoing digital line and RS484 half duplex line. The incoming signals are then completely isolated from the outgoing signals. 

This board is inserted between a some control electronics and a high power LED panel.
